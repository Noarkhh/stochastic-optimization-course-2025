# Stochastic Methods in Machine Learning

This repository contains laboratory materials for the "Stochastic Methods in Machine Learning" course at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow.

## Course Description

This course explores various problems at the intersection of optimization and machine learning.

## Labs Overview

| Lab | Title | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Gradient Descent | Implements gradient descent algorithm to train a linear regression model from scratch. |
| 2 | Gradient Descent Extensions | Covers gradient descent extensions including Momentum, AdaGrad, and Adam. Students test these optimizers on standard benchmark test functions: Sphere, Rosenbrock, Rastrigin. |
| 3 | Adversarial Examples | Investigates the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks, implementing the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate perturbations that cause misclassification. |
